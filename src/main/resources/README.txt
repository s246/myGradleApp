In order to solve the exercise problem I used a quick solution that could be used for the openning day of the mentioned fictional Mart.
The applications is a fully functionally desktop application developed in Java and uses JavaFx in order to have a user interface.
The application is simple and could be used by anyone.
It icludes two .txt files to keep track of the inventory in the Mart and the transaction id. 
The application generates the receipt like the execrcise indicated.


Requirements (JAVA JDK 11)

Execucion UNIX (opening a terminal in the location of THIS file):
1.- javac --module-path javafx_UNIX/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml *.java
2.- java --module-path javafx_UNIX/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml JerrysMarktApp
